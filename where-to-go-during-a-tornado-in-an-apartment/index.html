<p>For added protection get under something sturdy (a heavy table or workbench). If that isn’t possible, make sure you got to the bottom floor of your apartment building, stay away from windows, and take shelter in a hallway or closet. When you’re in your apartment during a tornado, your first course of action should be to head towards the lowest.</p>
