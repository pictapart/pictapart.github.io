What Causes Garage Doors Not to Close? (Explained From familylifeshare.com</p>
<p>Sometimes the problem is with the rail itself. If your garage door refuses to close when you push your remote control or the wired switch mounted to your wall, your first check should be the safety sensors. If your garage door won’t close all the way, it’s probably an issue with your sensors. If you think this might be the case have a look around your garage and move anything that might be too close to the door.</p>
<h3 id="these-sensors-detect-when-small-children-pets-or-obstructions-block-the-garage-doors-path-helping-to-keep-everyone-safe">These sensors detect when small children, pets, or obstructions block the garage door’s path, helping to keep everyone safe.</h3><p>Look for a wiring issue at the sensor itself. The cold weather may be effecting your rollers, making them stiff and unable to work as well. Then, inspect where the wires are connected to the back of the motor head. The door will not close completely if the bolt is too high on the rail. If something gets in the way of this signal, such as a child or pet, your garage door’s safety mechanism kicks in and it won’t shut. One of the most common causes of a garage door that won’t close during the wintertime is condensation on the safety sensors.</p>
