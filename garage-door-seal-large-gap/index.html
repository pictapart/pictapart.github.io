Garage Door Gap Seal From garagedoorgap.com</p>
<p>This item works similarly to window and door weather stripping for the garage and helps fill gaps and spaces to insulate and weatherize your garage. Gaps along the sides and top of the door let in wind, rain and snow, and gaps along the floor let in not just weather but also critters. It keeps the garage door pressed up against the outside rubber seal so cold air is not blowing through the gap. Garage doors are very large, and while all come with a bottom seal to keep out water, wind, dirt, and unwanted intruders, the seals themselves can break down over time.</p>
<h3 id="when-a-garage-door-is-installed-and-for-the-lifetime-of-your-garage-door-it-should-close-and-the-bottom-should-seal-to-the-bottom-of-your-driveway">When a garage door is installed, and for the lifetime of your garage door, it should close and the bottom should seal to the bottom of your driveway.</h3><p>There are times and instances where the garage door will not quite seal to the driveway, leaving a small gap. Garage door seals work much like the classic frost king door sweeps and help to prevent dirt, dust, water, insects.

They’re there to create a seal when your garage door is closed, keeping the door from staying open and keeping the weather out of your garage. I would go with the 6 inch in your case because of that rather large 2 inch gap. When you have a beautiful straight floor, then you can go for either 3 or 4″.</p>
