<p>Basically, if you have renters insurance at one apartment and move to another, your personal property is covered at both locations for a period of up to 30 days while you are moving the property between locations. If you can afford it, overlap a month or two weeks to get the new apartment ready. That’s the end of your lease. They have always “prorated” out extra days and i’ve never planned a move without a bit of overlap where i’m paying for rent on both apartments for a little while!</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-create-a-lease-through-apartmentscom">How do i create a lease through apartments.com?</h3><p>How do i correct a lease overlap error? Should i do that closer to the end of september or should i leave myself some overlap? How do i create a lease through apartments.com? Tenant will be charged a monthly fee of $25.00 in addition to their monthly rent to cover the cost of this insurance.
