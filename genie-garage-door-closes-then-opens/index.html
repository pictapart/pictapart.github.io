<p>Genie garage door starts to close then goes back up. Press and hold the wall console button until the garage door is completely closed. Your garage door is programmed to travel a certain distance before it closes. This short circuit may happen in either the remote control or the wall keypad.</p>
<h3 id="press-the-button-on-your-remote-to-close-the-garage-door">Press the button on your remote to close the garage door.</h3><p>If there is anything that interrupts or breaks that beam when the garage door is trying to close, the door is going to reverse and go back up. If the door is working properly it should be easy to lift by hand. To give you information about these, the travel limit controls how far your garage door opens and closes during its operation, while force limit controls how much pull is needed to get the door completely open. In this guide, i will discuss why the genie garage door sensor blinking red and its solution. The garage door can be operated manually by disconnecting the garage door opener from the door using the red pull cord. The only thing i can think of that was unusual before i started having trouble was that i had the power turned off for a few hours.</p>
